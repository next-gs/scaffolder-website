Scaffolder is developed by [Michael Barton][6], written in Ruby, and open
sourced under the [MIT license][1]. The code for both the [scaffolder API][2]
and the [scaffolder command line tool][3] are hosted on gitub. In each case
the master git branch contains the latest stable version. The most recent
developments can be found on the develop branch.

Scaffolder is actively developed and therefore patches and pull requests are
welcome. These should ideally be specified by [RSpec][4] unit tests.
[Cucumber][5] integration scenarios for new or changed behaviour are also very
welcome. Bug reports can be made using the github issue tracker at each
repository. A [scaffolder Google group][7] is available for any questions or
comments.
